# Weather_time
Module 06 Challenge

## Description
This challenge involved creating a dashboard that provides weather conditions for cities. The user can enter a city name and it will search for and match the closest city with that name. It will provide current conditions in addition to a 5-day forecast. If it cannot find the city, it will alert the user. It will store the city in a list on the left side and as the user searches for more cities, they will be added to the list. The user is able to click cities that appear on the list to switch between them.
